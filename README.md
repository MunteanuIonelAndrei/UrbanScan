# UrbanScan: City Problem Management System with Drone Surveillance

A comprehensive city management system consisting of two main components:
1. **CityProject** - Web application for citizens to report city problems and for officials to manage reports
2. **BothUI** - Drone control and surveillance system that integrates with the main platform

## Project Overview

UrbanScan provides an end-to-end solution for:
- Citizens to report city problems with photos and locations
- City officials to manage and resolve reported issues
- Drone-assisted surveillance for monitoring and validating reports
- AI-powered analysis of reports and drone imagery

## System Components

### CityProject

A web-based platform with:
- **Frontend**: React-based interfaces for citizens and administrators
- **Backend**: Python FastAPI application with PostgreSQL database
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI-powered analysis of reports for validity and classification

### BothUI

A drone control system with:
- **Backend**: Python-based drone control for Raspberry Pi + Pixhawk flight controller
- **Signaling Server**: WebRTC signaling for real-time communication
- **Admin Interface**: React-based web UI for drone operation and surveillance

## Installation and Setup

Each component requires its own specific setup. Please refer to the individual README files in each directory for detailed installation instructions:

- [CityProject README](/cityProject/README.md) - Main web application setup
- [BothUI Backend README](/bothUI/backend/README.md) - Drone controller setup
- [BothUI WebRTC Admin README](/bothUI/webrtc-admin/README.md) - Drone admin interface setup

### Quick Start

1. **Set up the CityProject web application**:
   ```bash
   cd cityProject/docker
   docker-compose up -d  # Start PostgreSQL
   
   cd ../backend
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   alembic upgrade head
   python -m app.initial_data  # Create initial admin user
   uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
   
   # In another terminal
   cd ../frontend/client
   npm install
   npm start
   
   # In another terminal
   cd ../frontend/admin
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

2. **Set up the BothUI Drone Control System**:
   ```bash
   # Start the signaling server
   cd bothUI/signaling-server
   npm install
   node server.js
   
   # On the Raspberry Pi (with Pixhawk connected)
   cd bothUI/backend
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python main.py
   
   # For the drone admin interface
   cd bothUI/webrtc-admin
   npm install
   npm start
   ```
